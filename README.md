## Hi there ðŸ‘‹
My name is Michael Garcia. I am currently going for an associates degree in Web Development. I chose web development because in the future I would like to get a career in a rapidly growing field so I would imagine positions in web development and software design are in high demand right now. My personal hobbies include cars, drawing, and music (also technology of course).
